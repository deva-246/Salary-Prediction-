# Salary-Prediction-Using -Linear regression
Predicting salary of a new joinee in a company with the previous records.

**Linear Regression**

> Linear regression is a statistical method used to predict the relationship between two variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The goal is to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship.
> It is used in data science and machine learning for predictive analysis. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm tries to apply relations that will predict the outcome of an event based on the independent variable data points.
> It attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. The relation is usually a straight line that best fits the different data points as close as possible.
> It is a proven way to scientifically and reliably predict the future.

**Steps to Implement the Machine learning Project**

1. Import necessary python libraries like
      a. numpy 
      b. matplotlib
      c. pandas 
      d. seaborn
2. Import the dataset and extract the predictor and the target value (ie.. the dependent and independent value) - (x and y)
3. Analyze and explore the dataset using required visualizations
4. Split the dataset into Train and Test
5. Fit the Linear Regression algorithm into training set
6. Predict the test results using predict()
7. Visualize the Training results
8. Visualize the Test results
9. Obtain the expected results in a scatter plot with required salary w.r.t experience in years.
10. Calculate the residuals with - MAE , MSE, RMSE
